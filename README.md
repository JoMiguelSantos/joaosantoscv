## My Interactive CV

This is the Python code for my interactice CV, built with Dash/Plotly libraries and deployed in HerokuApp.

This project also used some CSS and HTML elements to enhance visualization and UI.

It is currently not being updated, even though you can check it at https://joaosantoscv.herokuapp.com/ (it takes a bit to load the first time because it's dorment at Heroku Servers)

I've built it about 1 year ago so for sure won't be the best example of my work but you can have a sample of my previous work.

Feel free to re-use the parts you need to build your own Dash app but I do not allow anyone to take ownership of the complete codebase and pass it as their own so please refrain to do so.
